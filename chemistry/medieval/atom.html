<h3>Democritus:</h3>

<p class="pmain2">In Ancient Greek, most philosophers held that the earth was composed of four elements - fire,
water, earth and air. One thinker, called Democritus, explained the structure of the universe in another way. He said that it was made up of infinitely minute particles differing from each other in size, weight, shape, etc., and that these particels were indivisible, invisible and indestructible. He called them "atoms", meaning that they are particles which could not be cut in two.</p>

<p class="pmain2">At the beginning the atoms were in constant motion, but they came together by chance and united in various ways to form solids, liquids and gases.</p>
