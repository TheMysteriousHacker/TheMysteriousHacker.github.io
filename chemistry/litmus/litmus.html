<h3>Slippery And Sour Substances:</h3>

<p class="pmain2">
	In ancient times, the Egyptians and Greeks defined certain substances based upon their taste. Both the
	Greeks and the Egyptians had discovered that one particular substance was very sour. This became to be
	known as vinegar. The Greeks used a variety of tests to distinguish compounds. One of these was taste,
	and they divided substances according to whether they were sour, bitter, salty or sweet. As the Greek
	influence waned and their knowledge passed on to the Romans, they began to refer to sour substances, such
	as vinegar or lemon juice, as acids.
</p>

<p class="pmain2">The Greeks were also familiar with a different category of substances. They found that some slippery
substances were left behind as residue after burning certain materials, like potash, which must have been the first to
be discovered and was produced from wood ashes, and lime, which was produced from burning seashells. Ultimately, the
Greeks discovered a new category to define substances based upon the property of feeling slippery.</p>

<p class="pmain2">To build on the Greek’s definition of sour or slippery, a new terminology was developed to speak about
things that felt slippery. From the Arabic word al-qaliy, which means "the ashes", the term<span style="color:#6600CC">
alkaline</span> was developed. <span style="color:red">Acid</span> came from French "acide" or directly from Latin
acidus "sour, sharp" and was loosely applied to any substance tasting like vinegar.</p>

<h3>The Litmus Definition:</h3>

<p class="pmain2">In about 1300, a Spanish scholar, Arnaldus de Villa Nova, began to use something called <span
style="color:#33CC33">litmus</span> for studying <span style="color:red">acids</span>. This compound, extracted
from a lichen, had been used as a dye since at least the time of the Vikings, but he was the first known scholar
to use it as a test of <span style="color:red">acidity</span>.</p>

<p class="pmain2"><span style="color:#33CC33">Litmus</span> is a water-soluble mixture of different dyes extracted
from lichens. <span style="color:#33CC33">Litmus</span> solutions can be prepared by dissolving these lichen-based
dyes in neutral-pH water and observing the change in color when chemicals of unknown pH are added.<span
style="color:#33CC33"> Litmus paper</span> is pH neutral paper soaked in <span style="color:#33CC33">litmus</span>
solution and dried. It’s a lot more convenient to use than <span style="color:#33CC33">litmus</span> solutions.</p>

<p class="pmain2">In 1663, a scientist named Robert Boyle discovered that <span style="color:red">acids</span> and <span
style="color:#6600CC">alkali</span> would change the color of <span style="color:#33CC33">litmus</span>. When extracted,
this dye is blue in color, but when <span style="color:red">acid</span> is added, the dye turns red. This was the first,
easy test, for <span style="color:red">acids</span>. As might be expected, <span style="color:#6600CC">alkali</span>
turned the <span style="color:#33CC33">litmus dye</span> from red to blue, and <span style="color:#33CC33">litmus</span>
is still used to this day to detect the relative amounts of <span style="color:red">acid</span> or <span
style="color:#6600CC">alkali</span> in a solution. Since Boyle's time, however, many more dyes and colored substances
have been discovered that also change color when exposed to <span style="color:red">acids</span> and or <span
style="color:#6600CC">alkali</span>, these were called indicators.</p>
