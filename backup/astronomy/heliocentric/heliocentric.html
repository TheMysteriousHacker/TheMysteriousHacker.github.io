<h3>Early Astronomy:</h3>

<p class="pmain2">
	The Earth centered, or geocentric, model of the solar system was developed by Aristotle around 350 B.C. and elaborated by Claudius Ptolemy of Alexandria around 150 A.D. There had been other mathematicians like the Pythagorean Philolaus who argued for a Sun centered, heliocentric, model of the solar system however the Aristotelians prevailed and Sun centered models of the solar system were forgotten for fifteen centuries.
</p>
<p class="pmain2">
	Ptolemy outlined his system in a treatise which has become known as the Almagest, meaning "the greatest." In the Ptolemaic system, each planet moved in a small circle known as an epicycle, whose centre was carried round the Earth in a larger orbit known as the deferens. For fourteen centuries astronomers computed planetary positions from tables based on this analysis.
</p>

<h3>Copernican Revolution:</h3>

<p class="pmain2">
	Astronomy made no major advances in strife-torn medieval Europe; but then, during the renaissance period, astronomy began to undergo a
	revolution in thought known as the Copernican revolution, which gets the name from the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, who proposed a
	heliocentric system, in which the planets revolved around the Sun and not the Earth. His book "De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium" was
	published in 1543. While in the long term this was a very controversial claim, in the very beginning it only brought minor controversy. The
	theory became the dominant view because many figures, most notably Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton championed and improved
	upon the work.
</p>

<p class="pmain2">
	Nicolaus Copernicus was a Polish cleric in the sixteenth century. He was born on February 19, 1473, in Torun, a mercantile town along the Vistula River. His training was in law and medicine, but his main interests were astronomy and mathematics. It is impossible to date when Copernicus first began to espouse the heliocentric theory, but it is likely that he adopted this theory after 1500. His first heliocentric writing was his Commentariolus ("Little Commentary"). It was a small manuscript that was circulated but never printed. Thereafter he continued gathering data for a more detailed work.
</p>
<p class="pmain2">
	The Commentariolus was only intended as an introduction to Copernicus’s ideas. In a sense it was an announcement of the greater work that
	Copernicus had begun. About 1532, Copernicus had basically completed his work on the manuscript of "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium"
	(On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres). The work is divided into six books, where the first one is a general vision of the heliocentric theory, so it would be sufficient to give a summary of his first book.
</p>

<h3>Book One Of De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (Summary):</h3>
<p class="pmain2">The Universe is Spherical:</p>
<p class="subText">
	First of all, we must note that the universe is spherical. The reason is either that, of all forms, the sphere is the most perfect, needing no joint and being a complete whole; or because it is most capacious and therefore best suited for that which is to contain and preserve all things; or again because all the perfect parts of it, namely, Sun, Moon and Stars, are so formed; or because all things tend to assume this shape, as is seen in the case of drops of water and liquid bodies in general if freely formed. No one doubts that such a shape has been assigned to Heavenly bodies. 
</p>
<p class="pmain2">The Earth too is Spherical:</p>
<p class="subText">
	The earth also is spherical, since it presses upon its center from every direction. A traveler going from any place toward the north, that pole of the daily rotation gradually climbs higher, while the opposite pole drops down an equal amount. More stars in the north are seen not to set, while in the south certain stars are no longer seen to rise. Thus Italy does not see Canopus, which is visible in Egypt. Meanwhile, the elevations of the poles have the same ratio everywhere to the portions of the earth that have been traversed.
</p>
<p class="subText">
	The waters press down into the same figure also, as sailors are aware, since land which is not seen from a ship is visible from the top of its mast. On the other hand, if a light is attached to the top of the mast, as the ship draws away from land, those who remain ashore see the light drop down gradually until it finally disappears, as though setting.
</p>
<p class="pmain2">The motion of the heavenly bodies is uniform, eternal, and circular or compounded of circular motions:</p>
<p class="subText">
	We must now note that the motion of the heavenly bodies is circular. In connection with the numerous [celestial] spheres, however, there are many motions. The most conspicuous of all is the daily rotation, which the Greeks call nuchthemeron, that is, the interval of a day and a night. The entire universe, with the exception of the earth, is conceived as whirling from east to west in this rotation.
</p>
<p class="subText">
	Secondly, we see other revolutions as advancing in the opposite direction, that is, from west to east; I refer to those of the sun, moon, and five planets. The sun thus regulates the year for us, and the moon the month, which are also very familiar periods of time. In like manner each of the other five planets completes its own orbit.
</p>
<p class="subText">
	Yet [these motions] differ in many ways. These bodies are not seen moving uniformly in their orbits, since the sun and moon are observed to be sometimes slow, at other times faster in their course. Moreover, we see the other five planets also retrograde at times, and stationary at either end [of the regression]. 
</p>
<p class="subText">
	Nevertheless, despite these irregularities, we must conclude that the motions of these bodies are ever circular or compounded of circles, because these non-uniformities recur regularly according to a constant law. This could not happen unless the motions were circular, since only the circle can bring back the past.
</p>
<p class="subText">
	A simple heavenly body cannot be moved by a single sphere nonuniformly. For this nonuniformity would have to be caused either by an inconstancy, whether imposed from without or generated from within, in the moving force or by an alteration in the revolving body. It is improper to conceive any such defect in objects constituted in the best order. It stands to reason, therefore, that their uniform motions appear nonuniform to us. The cause may be either that their circles have poles different [from the earth’s] or that the earth is not at the center of the circles on which they revolve.
</p>
<p class="pmain2">Does circular motion suit the earth? What is its position?:</p>
<p class="subText">
	There is general agreement among the authorities that the earth is at rest in the middle of the universe. They hold the contrary view to be inconceivable or downright silly. Nevertheless, if we examine the matter more carefully, we shall see that this problem has not yet been solved.
</p>
<p class="subText">
	Every observed change of place is caused by a motion of either the observed object or the observer or, it is caused by an unequal displacement of each. For when things move with equal speed in the same direction, the motion is not perceived between the observed object and the observer. If some motion is ascribed to Earth, the same motion will appear in all that is exernal to Earth, but in the opposite direction.  Such in particular is the daily rotation, since it seems to involve the entire universe except the earth and what is around it. However, if you grant that the heavens have no part in this motion but that the
	earth rotates from west to east, you will find that this is the actual situation concerning the apparent rising and setting of the sun, moon, stars and planets. This view was certainly that of Heraclides and Ecphantus the Pythogorean and Hicetas of Syracuse (according to Cicero); for they thought that the stars set because the Earth blocked the view of them.
</p>
<p class="subText">
	There is another difficulty, namely, the position of the Earth. There has been virtually unanimous acceptance of the belief that the middle of the universe is the earth. Now, grant that Earth is not at the exact centre but at a distance from it which, while small compared to the sphere of the fixed stars, is yet considerable compared to the orbits of Sun and the other planets; then calculate the consequent variations in their seeming motions, assuming these to be really uniform and about the some centre other than the Earth's. One may then perhaps adduce a reasonable cause for these variable motions. The fact that the same planets are observed nearer to the earth and farther away necessarily proves that the center of the earth is not	the center of their circles. It is less clear whether the approach and withdrawal are executed by the earth or the planets.
</p>

<p class="pmain2">The Vastness of the Heavens Compared to the Size of the Earth:</p>
<p class="subText">
	Let the circle ABCD represent the celestial horizon, and E be the point from which we observe.
</p>
<img src="abcd.png" class="displayimg2">
<p class="subText">
	Suppose that from point E we observe with Dioptra or Astrolabe the first point of the sign Cancer rising at C and at the same moment the first point of Capricorn setting at A. AEC, since it is observed as a straight line through Dioptra, is a diameter of the Ecliptic, for six Zodiacal Signs form a semicircle and its centre E coincides with the centre the horizon.
</p>
<p class="subText">
	Next, suppose that after some time the first point of Capricorn rises at B; then Cancer will be seen setting at D, and BED will be a stright line, a diameter of the ecliptic. Hence, it is clear that E, the point of intersection of the two lines, is the centre of the horizon. Therefore the horizon always bisects the ecliptic.
</p>
<p class="subText">
	Yet a line drawn from the earth's surface [to a point in the firmament] must be distinct from the line drawn from the earth's center [to the same point]. Nevertheless, because these lines are immense in relation to the earth, they become like parallel lines. For in comparison with their length the space enclosed by them becomes imperceptible.
</p>
<p class="subText">
	It therefore follows that the Heavens are immeasurable in comparison with the Earth. Thus the Earth appears as a mere point compared to the Heavens, as a finite thing to the infinite. Yet it does not follow that the Earth must be at rest at the centre of the Universe. Indeed, a rotation in twenty-four hours of the enormously vast universe should astonish us even more than a rotation of its least part, which is the earth.
</p>
<p class="subText">
	The argument that the center is motionless, and what is nearest the center moves the least, does not prove that the earth is at rest in the middle of the universe. Suppose you say that the heavens rotate but the poles are stationary, and what is closest to the poles moves the least. The Little Bear, for example, being very close to the pole, is observed to move much more slowly than the Eagle or the Little Dog because it describes a smaller circle. Yet all these constellations belong to a single sphere. These
	are brought round in equal times, though not over equal spaces, by the rotation	of the whole sphere. The upshot of the argument, then, is the claim that the earth as a part of the celestial sphere shares in the same nature and movement so that, being close to the center, it has a slight motion. Therefore, being a body and not the center, it too will describe arcs like those of a celestial circle, though smaller, in the same time. The falsity of this contention is clearer than daylight. For it would always have to be noon in one place, and always midnight in another, so that the daily risings and settings could not take place, since the motion of the whole and the part would be one and inseparable.
</p>
<p class="subText">
	A quite different theory is required to explain the various motions observed, namely the bodies moving in smaller paths revolve more quickly than those moving in larger paths. Thus Saturn, most distant of the Planets, revolves in 30 years, and Moon, nearest Earth, compasses her circuit in a month. Lastly, then, the Earth must be taken to go round in the course of a day and a night.
