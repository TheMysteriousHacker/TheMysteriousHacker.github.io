<h3>Condensed Story Of Adam And Allah's Promise</h3>
<p>Allah the Almighty addressed him:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="7:22">
    وَنَادَىٰهُمَا رَبُّهُمَآ أَلَمْ أَنْهَكُمَا عَن تِلْكُمَا ٱلشَّجَرَةِ وَأَقُل لَّكُمَآ إِنَّ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنَ لَكُمَا عَدُوٌّۭ مُّبِينٌۭ
</p>
<p class="quote">"Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you: Verily Satan is an open enemy unto you?"</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="7:23-25"></p>
<p class="quote">
    They said: "Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your Mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers." Allah said, "Get down, one of you an enemy to the other (Adam, Eve, and Satan etc). On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment, for a time." He said: "Therein you shall live and therein you shall die, and from it you shall be brought out (resurrected)."
</p>
<p>
    Al Hafez Ibn Asaker narrated that Allah commanded two angels to remove Adam from His holy proximity. So Gabriel stripped him of the crown on his head, and Michael took the diadem from his forehead. Adam thought that his punishment had been hastened and bowed down crying; "Forgiveness! Forgiveness!" so Allah asked: "Are you running away from Me?" Adam replied, "No, my Lord, but I am shy of You."
</p>
<p>
    Abdul Rahman Ibn Amru Al - Awza'iy said that Adam spent 100 years in Paradise. In another narration it was said he spent 60 years.
</p>
<p>
    Ibn Asaker reported that Adam wept for 60 years for his loss of Paradise and 70 years for his mistake, and he wept for another 70 years when his son was killed.
