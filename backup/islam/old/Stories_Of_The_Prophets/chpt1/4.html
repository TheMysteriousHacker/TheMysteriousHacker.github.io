<h3>Teaching Adam</h3>
<p>
	Almighty Allah granted Adam the power to know the natures of all things and to summarize them by names; that is a bird, that is a star,
	that is a tree, etc Allah implanted in Adam an insatiable need for and love of knowledge and a desire to bequeath knowledge to his children.
	This was the reason for his creation and the secret of his glorification.
</p>
<p>
	After Adam had learned the names of all things, along with their properties and uses, Allah presented them to the angels and said:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="2:31">أَنۢبِـُٔونِى بِأَسْمَآءِ هَٰٓؤُلَآءِ إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ</p>
<p class="quote">
	Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful.
</p>
<p>The angels admitted their inability:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="2:32"></p>
<p class="quote">Glory be to You, we have knowledge except what You have taught us. Verily it is You the All Knower, the All Wise.</p>
<p>Allah Almighty then turned to Adam:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="2:33"></p>
<p class="quote">
	O Adam! Inform them of their names," and when he had informed them of their names, He said: 'Did I not tell you that I know the unseen in
	the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you have been hiding?'
</p>
<p>
	The angels realized that Adam was the creature who knew what they did not know and that his capacity to learn was his noblest quality. His
	knowledge included knowledge of the Creator which we call faith or Islam, as well as the knowledge he would need to inhabit and master the
	earth. All kinds of worldly knowledge which are included in this.
</p>
<p>
	Adam knew the names of everything. Sometimes he talked to the angels, but they were preoccupied with worshipping Almighty Allah. Therefore
	Adam, felt lonely. One day he slept and when he awoke he found near his head, a woman gazing at his face with beautiful tender eyes. The
	angels asked him her name he replied: "Eve (Hawa)." (means living things). They asked: "Why did you call her Eve?" Adam said: "Because she
	was created of me and I am a living being."
