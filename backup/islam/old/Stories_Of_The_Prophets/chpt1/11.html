<h3>Encounter Between Adam and Moses (PBUT) - Hadith</h3>
<p>
    Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger (PBUH) said: "Adam and Moses argued with each other. Moses said to Adam: 'Your sin expelled you from Paradise.' Adam said: 'You are Moses whom Allah selected as His messenger and as the one to whom He spoke directly. Yet you blame me for a thing which had already been written in my fate before my Creation?" Allah's Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said twice, "So Adam outclassed Moses."

    Umar Ibn Al Khattab also narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: "Moses (PBUH) said: 'My Lord! May I see Adam who removed us and himself from the Paradise?" So Allah made him see Adam and he said to him: "Are you Adam?" Adam said: "Yes." And he said "Were you the one in Whom Allah breathed His spirit and before whom He bowed His angels and to whom He taught the names of all things?" Adam answered: "Yes." So Moses said: "What made you remove us and yourself from Paradise.?" Adam said: "Who are you?" Moses said: "I am Moses." Adam said: "So you are Moses the prophet of the Children of Israel. Were you the one Allah spoke to directly?" Moses answered "Yes." Adam said: "Why do you blame me for a matter which Allah had predestined?" So Allahâ€™s Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said twice, "Adam outclassed Moses."
