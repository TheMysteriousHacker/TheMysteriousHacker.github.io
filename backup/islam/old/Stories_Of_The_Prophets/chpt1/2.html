<h3>Almighty Allah Also Revealed</h3>
<p>
  Allah the Almighty revealed:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="7:11"></p>
<p class="quote">
	And surely, We created you (your father Adam) and then gave you shape (the noble shape of a human being), then We told the angels,
	"Prostrate to Adam", and they prostrated, except Iblis, he refused to be those who prostrate.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="7:12-13"></p>
<p class="quote">
	Allah said: "What prevented you (O Iblis) that you did not postrate when I commanded you?" Iblis said: "I am better than him (Adam), You
	created me from fire and him You created from clay." Allah said: "O Iblis get down from this (Paradise), it is not for you to be arrogant
	here." Get out for you are of those humiliated and disgraced."
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="7:14"></p>
<p class="quote">
	Iblis said: "Allow me respite till the Day they are raised up (Day of Resurrection)."
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="7:15"></p>
<p class="quote">
	Allah said: "You are of those allowed respite."
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="7:16-18"></p>
<p class="quote">
	Iblis said: "Because You have sent me astray, surely I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your Straight Path. Then I will come
	to them from before them and behind them, from their right and from their left and You will not find most of them as thankful ones (they
	will not be dutiful to You)." Allah said: "Get out from Paradise, disgraced and expelled. Whoever of them (mankind) will follow you, then
	surely I will fill Hell with you all."
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="7:19"></p>
<p class="quote">
	"And O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in Paradise, and eat thereof as you both wish, but approach not this tree otherwise you both will be
	of the Zalimeen (unjust and wrongdoers)."
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="7:20-21"></p>
<p class="quote">
	Then Satan whispered suggestions to them both in order to uncover that which was hidden from them of their private parts before, he said:
	"Your Lord did not forbid you this tree save you should become angels or become of the immortals." Satan swore by Allah to them both
	saying: "Verily I am one of the sincere well wishers for you both."
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="7:22"></p>
<p class="quote">
	So he misled them with deception. Then when they tasted of the tree, that which was hidden from them of their shame (private parts) became
	manifest to them and they began to stick together the leaves of Paradise over themselves (in order to cover their shame). Their Lord called
	out to them saying "Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you, Verily Satan is an open enemy unto you?"
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="7:23"></p>
<p class="quote">
	They said: "Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your Mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers."
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="7:24-25"></p>
<p class="quote">
	Allah said: "Get down one of you an enemy to the other (i.e. Adam, Eve, and Satan etc). On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an
	enjoyment, for a time." He said: "therein you shall live, and therein you shall die, and from it you shall be brought out (resurrected)."
</p>
<p>
	We imagine when Allah the Almighty decided to create Adam: He addressed His angels and told them to prostrate before him. He did not mean
	to ask their opinion or take their advice, for He is above that. Allah the Exalted told them that He was going to create a vicegerent on
	the earth who would have children and grandchildren who would corrupt the earth and shed each other's blood. That is why the angels said to
	Allah the Almighty: "Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood!"
</p>
<p>
	There are old traditions about the angels before the creation of Adam. According to Ibn Qatadah, it was said that the angels were informed
	about the creation of Adam and his progency by the jinn who lived before Adam. Abdullah Ibn Umar said that the jinn had existed for about
	2000 years before Adam and then shed blood. Therefore Allah sent on them an army of angels that drove them out to the depths of the seas.
</p>
<p>
	Ibn Abi Hatim narrated from Ali jafar Al Baqer that the angels were informed that man would cause wickedness and shed blood on earth. It
	was also said that they knew that no one would be created on earth who would not be wicked and shed blood.
</p>
<p>
	Whether or not these traditions are correct, the angels did understand that Allah would create a vicegerent on earth. Allah the Almighty
	announced that He was going to create a human being out of clay, that He would mold him and blow His spirit into him and then the angels
	should prostrate before him.
</p>
<p>
	Abi Musa al Sha'arai narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said: "Allah created Adam from a handful of dust taken from different lands,
	so the children of Adam have been created according to the composition of the land. Therefore from mankind we have white, red, black and
	yellow ones; we have good and evil, ease and sorrow, and what comes in between them."<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Ibn Masud and other companions of the Prophet (pbuh) said that Allah the Almighty sent Gabriel onto the earth to said that Allah the
	Almighty sent Gabriel onto the earth to get Him clay therefrom. The earth said: "I seek refuge in Allah from your decreasing my quantity or
	disfiguring me." So Gabriel returned and did not take anything. He said: "My Lord, the land sought refuge in You and it granted."
</p>
<p>
	So Allah sent Michael for the same purpose, and the land sought refuge with Allah and it was granted. So he went back and said to Allah
	what Gabriel has said before him. Then Allah sent the Angel of Death, and the land sought refuge in Allah, the angel said: "I also seek
	refuge with Allah from returning without carrying out His command." So he took clay from the face of the earth and mixed it. He did not
	take from one particular place, but rather he took white, red, and black clay from different places. 
</p>
<p>
	The Angel of Death ascended with it, Allah soaked the clay till it became sticky. Then Allah said to the angels:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="38:71-72"></p>
<p class="quote">
	Truly, I am going to create man from clay. So when I have fashioned him and breathed into him (his) soul created by Me, then you fall down
	prostrate to him.
</p>
<p>
	So Allah shaped Adam into a human being, but he remained a figure of clay for fourty years. The angels went past him. They were seized with
	fear by what they saw, and Iblis felt fear most. He used to pass by the figure of Adam, buffeting it, which would make a sound like pottery.
	Allah told us: 
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="55:14"></p>
<p class="quote">
	He created man (Adam) from sounding clay like the clay of pottery.
</p>
<p>
	When the time drew near to breathe the spirit into Adam, as Allah decreed, He commanded the angels: "When I breathe My spirit into him
	prostrate before him." Allah breathed His spirit into Adam and when it reached his head Adam sneezed. The angels said: "Say all praise
	belongs to Allah." Adam repeated: "All praise belongs to Allah." Allah said to him: "Your Lord has granted you mercy." When the spirit
	reached his eyes, Adam looked at the fruits of Paradise. When it reached his abdomen Adam felt an appetite for food. He jumped hurriedly
	before the spirit could reach his legs, so that he could eat from the fruits of Paradise. Allah, therefore, said:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="21:37"></p>
<p class="quote">Man is created of haste.</p>
<p>And then:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="15:31-32"></p>
<p class="quote">The angels prostrated themselves all of them together. Except Iblis, he refused to be among the prostrators.</p>
<p>
	Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: "Allah created Adam from dust after He mixed the clay and left him for some
	time until it became sticky mud, after which Allah shaped him. After that Allah left him till it became like potter's clay. Iblis used to
	go past him saying 'You have been created for a great purpose.' After that Allah breathed His spirit into him. The first thing into which
	the spirit passed was his eye and then his nose. He sneezed. Allah said: "May your Lord have mercy upon you, O Adam! Go to those angels and
	see what they would say.' So Adam went and greeted them. they replied saying: "Peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of Allah."
	Allah said: "O Adam! This is your greeting and that of your offspring."
