<h3>The Meaning Of The Angel's Prostration</h3>
<p>
	Adam opened his eyes and saw all the angels prostrating before him except one being who was standing at a distance Adam did not know what
	kind of creature it was that did not prostrate before him nor did he know its name. Iblis was standing with the angels so as to be included
	in the command given to them but he was not one of them. He was a jinn, and as such he was supposed to be inferior to the angels. What is
	clear is that this prostration was to show respect and did not mean that the angels were worshipping Adam. Prostrating in worship is done
	only for Allah.. Almighty Allah recounted the story of Iblis's refusal to prostate before Adam:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="15:28-31"></p>
<p class="quote">
	Remember when your Lord said to the angels, 'I am going to create a man (Adam) from sounding clay of altered black smooth mud. So when I
	have fashioned him completely and breathed into him (Adam) the soul which I created for him then fall you down prostrating yourselves unto
	him.' So the angels prostrated themselves all of them together, except Iblis, he refused to be among the prostrators.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="15:32-35"></p>
<p class="quote">
	Allah said: 'O Iblis! What is your reason for not being among the prostrators?' Iblis said: 'I am not the one to prostrate myself to a
	human being, whom You created from sounding clay of altered black smooth mud.' Allah said: 'Then get out from here for verily you are Rajim
	(an outcast or cursed one). Verily the curse shall be upon you till Day of Recompense (Day of Resurrection).
</p>
<p>
	Ibn Jarir reported that Muhammad Ibn sirin said that the first one to reach a conclusion by reasoning was Iblis and that the sun and moon
	were not worshiped except through this method. This means that Iblis tried to compare himself to Adam. He believed that he was more
	honorable than Adam. Therefore he abstained from prostrating even though Allah had commanded him to do so, just as He had commanded the
	angels.
</p>
<p>Iblis tried in vain to justify his refusal:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="17:62"></p>
<p class="quote">
	Shall I prostrate to one whom You created from clay?" Iblis said: "See? those whom You have honored above me, if You give me respite (keep
	me alive) to the Day of Resurrection, I will surely seize and mislead his offspring (by sending them astray) all but a few!
</p>
<p>
	Allah knew that Iblis was not going to obey Him in prostrating before Adam. Allah could have totally annihilated him or turned him into a
	handful of dust or stifled the refusal in his mouth. Yet, Allah gives His commissioned creatures absolute freedom even to the extent that
	they can refuse Allah the Almighty's commands. He grants them the freedom of denial, disobedience, and even disagreement with Him.
</p>
<p>
	There were many traditions about Iblis at the time of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Ibn Masud, Ibn Abbas and a group of the companions of the
	Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said that Iblis had been the head of the angels in the worldly heavens. Ibn Abbas said in one narration that his
	name had been Azazil and in another narration he said it had been Al Harith. Ibn Abbas also said that Iblis was a jinn and that they had
	once been the keepers of Paradise, with Iblis the most honorable and the most learned and the most pious of them.
