<h3>Adam's Weakness</h3>
<p>
	Adam and Eve understood that they were forbidden to eat the fruit of that tree. Adam was however a human being and man tends to forget. His
	heart changes and his will weakens. Iblis summoned all the envy within him and took advantage of Adam's humanity to exploit him. He started
	to whisper to him day after day, coaxing him: "Shall I guide you to the Tree of Immortality and the Eternal Kingdom?" He said to them:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="7:20-21">مَا نَهَىٰكُمَا رَبُّكُمَا عَنْ هَٰذِهِ ٱلشَّجَرَةِ إِلَّآ أَن تَكُونَا مَلَكَيْنِ أَوْ تَكُونَا مِنَ ٱلْخَٰلِدِينَ, وَقَاسَمَهُمَآ إِنِّى لَكُمَا لَمِنَ ٱلنَّٰصِحِينَ</p>
<p class="quote">
	"Your Lord did not forbid you this tree save you should become angels or become of the immortals." He (Satan) swore by Allah to them both
	saying: "Verily I am one of the sincere well wishers for you both."
</p>
<p>
	Years went by, and Adam and Eve were preoccupied with thoughts of that tree. Then one day they decided to eat of its fruit. They forgot
	that Allah had warned them not to approach it and that Iblis was their sworn enemy. Adam stretched out his hand, picked one of the fruits
	and offered it to Eve. They both ate of the forbidden tree.
</p>
<p>Allah the Almighty revealed:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="7:27"></p>
<p class="quote">
	O Children of Adam! Let not Satan deceive you, as he got your parents (Adam and Eve) out of Paradise stripping them of their rainments; to
	show them their private parts. Verily he and Qabiluhu (his soldiers from the jinn or his tribe) see you from where you cannot see them.
	Verily, We made the devils (protectors and helpers) for those who believe not.
</p>
<p>
	Adam had hardly finished eating when he felt his heart contract, and he as filled with pain, sadness and shame. He discovered that he and
	his wife were naked, so they both started cutting tree leaves with which to cover themselves.
