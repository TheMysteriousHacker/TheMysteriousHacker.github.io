<h3>Learning The Beneficial Knowledge Derived From The Book Of Allaah And The Sunnah Of His Messenger (PBUH)</h3>
<p>
	Ibn Rajab defines this knowledge, saying:
</p>
<p class="quote">
	Beneficial knowledge is to define, accurately and meticulously, the texts of the Book and Sunnah and to understand them.
</p>
<p class="quote">
	It is to confine oneself in regard to this, to the reports transmitted from the Companions, their successors and their successors in turn
	which pertain to the explanation and understanding of the Quraan and Hadeeths, as well as the discourse related from them on issues of the
	lawful, unlawful, zuhd (asceticism), raqaaiq (matters that soften the heart), the (various) branches of knowledge and so on.
</p>
<p class="quote">
	It is also, to firstly exert efforts towards distinguishing the authentic reports from the unauthentic, then secondly to exert efforts
	towards seeking out their meanings and gaining an understanding of them. This is sufficient for the intelligent and (enough) labor for the
	one who is concerned and preoccupies himself with the beneficial knowledge.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Whoever has been granted the tawfeeq to this knowledge has been granted the tawfeeq to the greatest cause for the increase of eemaan.
	Anyone who contemplates on the texts of the Book and Sunnah will realize this. Allaah says:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="43:6">وَيَرَى الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْعِلْمَ الَّذِي أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ هُوَ الْحَقَّ</p>
<p class="quote">
	And those who have been given knowledge see that what is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth
</p>
<p>
	Recorded in the Saheehayn, is the hadeeth of Muaawiyah, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which he says: The Messenger of Allaah pbuh said:
</p>
<p class="quote">
	Whomever Allaah desires good for, He imparts upon him understanding of the religion.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Related in al-Musnad and other sources, is the hadeeth of Aboo ad Dardaa, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which he says, The Messenger
	of Allaah pbuh said:
</p>
<p class="quote">
	He who treads a path in search of knowledge Allaah will direct him to tread a path from the paths of Paradise. The Angels lower their wings
	for the student of knowledge in approval of what he does. All in the heavens and earth and the fish in the depth of the water seek
	forgiveness for the scholar, and the superiority of the scholar over the worshipper is like the superiority of the full moon at night over
	the rest of the stars. Verily the scholars are the heirs to the Prophets. Verily, the Prophets did not bequeath deenars or dirhams. All
	they left behind was knowledge, so whoever takes it, has indeed acquired a huge fortune.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Thus, the scholar knows his Lord, his Prophet and the commands and boundaries set by Allaah. He distinguishes between that which Allaah
	loves and is pleased with, and that which He hates and rejects. Thus, he acts in accordance to the commands of Allaah with respect to
	that which he approaches and refrains from. 
</p>
<p>
	This is true for the one who is given the tawfeeq towards acting upon that which He knows, if however the case is the opposite, his
	knowledge will be a curse for him.
</p>
<p>
	Al-Aajurree states in the introduction to his book Akhlaaq al-Ulamaa, 
</p>
<p class="quote">
	Allaah, sanctified are His names, singled out those of His creation whom He loved and then guided them to eemaan. He further singed out
	from amongst the believers those whom He loved and favored them by teaching them the Book and Hikmah.
</p>
<p class="quote">
	He granted them the tawfeeq in the religion, taught them the explanation and favored them over the rest of the believers. This is the case
	in every age and place. Allaah elevated them with knowledge and adorned them with forbearance. Through them, the lawful is known from the
	unlawful, the truth from falsehood, the harmful from the beneficial, and the good from the bad.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Knowledge is therefore, not sought after in itself but for something else, and that is action. Consequently, every type of knowledge within
	the Sharee'ah that the law of Islam calls for is demanded because it is a means to the worship of Allaah and for no other reason. This is
	proven by the following facts.
</p>
<p>
	Firstly, the sharee'ah has not brought anything but worship, this is the reason behind the dispatching of the Prophets. Allaah says:
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="21:25"></p>
<p class="quote">And We sent not before you any messenger except that We revealed to him that, "There is no deity except Me, so worship Me."</p>
<p>
	Secondly, there are evidences that indicate the spirit of knowledge to be action and that without action, knowledge is bare and of no
	benefit. Allaah has said,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="35:28">إِنَّمَا يَخْشَى اللَّهَ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ الْعُلَمَاءُ</p>
<p class="quote">It is only those who have knowledge amongst His slaves who fear Allaah</p>
<p>
	All the reports related on the excellence of knowledge are only established from the perspective that the person is obliged to act upon
	this knowledge.
</p>
<p>
	Thirdly, there are severe warnings, threats and harsh reprimands mentioned in the texts of the Shareeah for the one who does not act in
	accordance to his knowledge. Allaah says,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="2:44"></p>
<p class="quote">
	Do you enjoin righteousness upon the people and forget yourselves (to practice it) whilst you recite the scripture? Have you then no sense?
</p>
<p>
	Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy upon him, mentioned this:
</p>
<p class="quote">
	Actions differ with respect to acceptance and rejection in proportion to their agreement or opposition to knowledge. Thus, the action that
	conforms to knowledge is the acceptable type, whereas, the action that opposes knowledge is the rejected type. Knowledge is the scale and
	it is the criterion.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>The increase of eemaan brought about by knowledge is achieved in many ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To travel in search of knowledge</li>
	<li>To sit with people of knowledge in their gatherings</li>
	<li>To study issues of knowledge in company</li>
	<li>To increase in knowledge of Allaah and His Sharee'ah</li>
</ul>
<p>
	As for the branches of sharee'ah knowledge that can cause an increase of eemaan, they are abundant. The following is a summarized selection
	of them:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Reciting And Following The Qur'aan</li>
	<li>Knowledge Of Allaah’s Names And Attributes</li>
	<li>To Look Attentively At The Prophet’s (PBUH) Biography</li>
	<li>Pondering Over The Merits And Qualities Of The Religion Of lslaam</li>
	<li>Reading The Life-History Of The Salaf Of This Ummah</li>
