<h3>Causes For The Increase Of Eemaan</h3>
<p>
	Allaah has set a cause and a way with which, one arrives at anything desired and anything sought after.
	For a surety, the greatest of all pursuits and the one that holds the most extensive of benefits, is none
	other than eemaan. Allaah has devised many constituents for it that bring it about and strengthen it, and
	many causes that increase and develop it. If the servants act on them, their certainty strengthens and
	their eemaan increases. Allaah has elaborated on these in His Book, as has His Messenger (PBUH)
	in his Sunnah. Possibly the more important of these causes are the following.
