  All praise is for Allaah, Lord of the worlds and may He praise, send peace and blessings upon our Messenger;
  his family and Companions.
</p>
<p>
	The greatest blessing Allaah, the Most High, can bestow upon a person in this world is the blessing of
	eemaan. It is as the author points out in his introduction the source to all the good in this world and
	Hereafter. However, as the texts unequivocal show and as a simple glance at the various types of people
	will show, eemaan is of levels. It is of degrees and forever fluctuating. This is a matter that a person
	can witness in himself: when he is active and obedient, he senses a strength of eemaan and when he is
	falling short of the mark and disobeying Allaah he feels that his eemaan is weak.
</p>
<p>
	Anyhow, this discussion before you is not to establish the fact that eemaan is of parts and that it
	increases and decreases - the evidences that point to this fact in the Qur'aan and Sunnah are numerous -
	even though this matter is extremely important as there does exist amongst Muslims the belief that eemaan
	is something whole and solid, which is not made up of parts and that everyone holds the same eemaan.
</p>
<p>
	The severity of this corrupt belief can be comprehended when one realizes that the holder of this belief will not therefore seek to find
	out the ways that will increase his eemaan in order to implement them and nor will he averse himself with the matters that can weaken his
	eemaan so that he can avoid them because of his lack of belief in the increase and decrease of eemaan! This person has therefore sealed
	this tremendous door and bars himself from entering to succeed in obedience and shun disobedience.
</p>
<p>
	This is exactly what happened to the groups who held such a belief. One group held that since eemaan does not increase and decrease,
	actions do not affect it and hence, they concluded that sins have no bearing upon ones Eemaan whatsoever. Another group did hold that
	eemaan is affected by action but as they again did not recognize that it was of levels and parts, they held that a person who commits a
	major sin is no longer a Muslim and he will reside in the Fire forever since his eemaan completely vanishes on account of the sin as it
	cannot decrease!
</p>
<p>
	Look at how Shaytaan deceives and plots against humankind to drive them towards disobedience in belief and action; we
	seek Allaah’s protection from the constant bombardment of his whispers.
</p>
<p>
	The discussion before you is directly connected to practical issues that relate to this subject: How does
	one actually increase in his eemaan? How can one safeguard himself from those matters that would
	otherwise weaken his eemaan? It is indeed a lofty discussion, which calls out to its reader to comprehend
	and implement it.
</p>
<p>
	The author of this excellent discussion is Shaykh ‘Abdur Razzaaq, the son of the illustrious scholar;
	Shaykh Abdul Muhsin ibn Hamad al-Abbaad al-Badr who is one of the scholars of al-Madeenah an-Nabawiyyah
	and a lecturer at the Prophet’s (PBUH) mosque, may Allaah preserve them both. Shaykh ‘Abdur-Razzaaq
	himself is a distinguished person of knowledge and he is an associate professor at the Department of
	Aqeedah in the Faculty of Da’wah and Usool ad-Deen at the Islamic University in al-Madeenah.

<p>
	Here is a summary of certain points found in the author's original work and elsewhere, which should help one
	towards the correct understanding of the term Eemaan.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Lexically, let alone from the Sharee’ah viewpoint, eemaan is not synonymous with tasdeeq (belief or
		faith).
	</li>
	<li>
		It is much closer in meaning to the word iqraar, which embodies the belief of the heart, which is
		tasdeeq as well as the action of the heart, which is inqiyaad (compliance and submissiveness).
	</li>
	<li>
		One can understand this even more so if he were to examine the contents of the Sharee’ah. The
		scrutinizer will find that it consists of two categories: (khabr) information and (amr) command.
		When Allaah tells us in the Qur’aan that we will be raised up after we die and that we will face him,
		this is information and one responds to it with belief in the heart (tasdeeq). However when Allaah
		orders us to fast the month of Ramadaan, we do not respond by saying: ‘Yes we believe’. Rather, what
		is required is compliance, since this is a command. The compliance intended here is the willingness
		in the heart to accept the command and enact it.
	</li>
	<li>
		Eemaan has a core or basic level, which if it is not in the heart, then eemaan cannot exist in such a
		heart. The last point is exactly this basic level: the belief of the heart and the basic levels of
		certain actions of the heart, such as the minimal level of compliance, love of Allaah, fear of Allaah,
		hope in Allaah and so on. Added to this, is the articulation by the tongue of the Shahaadah for the
		one who wishes to embrace lslaam and has the ability to speak. This type of Eemaan is what is termed
		as being a condition for the correctness and validity of eemaan.
	</li>
	<li>
		Eemaan has higher parts and levels, above the core level. This is where those who possess Eemaan
		become of different ranks and this is where the increase and decrease occurs. Hence, with regard to
		the actions of the heart, some have a greater love of Allaah than others, while others fear him more
		and rely on him more. Concerning the actions of the tongue, some recite Quraan more than others,
		some engage in much remembrance, speak only good etc. Likewise, people differ in the actions of the
		limbs: some pray tahajjud, perform jihaad etc. in contrast to others.
	</li>
	<li>
		Eemaan in the Sharee’ah is defined how the Prophet (PBUH) defined it when questioned by jibraa’eel:
		Eemaan in Allaah, the Angels, the Books, the Messengers, the Last Day and al-Qadar. As for the nature
		of eemaan and where it manifests itself this is where the scholars have defined it with five
		important matters: it manifests itself in the heart, the tongue and upon the limbs and it increases
		and decreases.
	</li>
	<li>
		Lastly, know that a misconception or error concerning the term eemaan is not like any other error
		concerning most other terms, because the rulings of this world and the Hereafter are connected to the
		terms of eemaan, lslaam, kufr, nifaaq etc. This important field of study, which embodies all of this,
		is referred to by some of the scholars as Baab al-Asmaa wa al-Ahkaam (the field of names and rulings)
		and Allaah knows best.
