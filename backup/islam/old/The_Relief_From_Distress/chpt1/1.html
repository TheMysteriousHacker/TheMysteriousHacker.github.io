<h3>May Allah Have Mercy Upon Him</h3>
<p>
	He is Ahmad bin Abdul-Halim bin Abdus-Salam bin Abdullah bin Abu Qasim ibn Taymiyyah al-Harrani Taqi
	ad-Din Abu al-Abbas bin Shihab ad-Din. He was born in Harran, an old city within the Arabian Peninsula
	between Syria' and Iraq, on the tenth or the twelfth of the month Rabi'ul-Awwal in the year 661H. He and
	his family were later forced to flee to Damascus due to the occupation by the Tartars.
</p>
<p>
	He came from a family of scholars, his father and grandfather were both scholars as were three of his
	brothers: Abdu-r-Rahman, Abdullah and his half-brother, Muhammad.
</p>
<p>
	During his early studies of Islam, he never ceased to amaze his teachers at the strength of his memory,
	keen intelligence and depth of understanding. It is said that he was first allowed to give legal verdicts
	at the age of nineteen and he began teaching at Dar al-Hadith as-Sukrijyah at the age of twenty-two.</p>
<p>
	He became famous for his knowledge of hadith, indeed he was a Hafiz (Hadith Master), and for his
	knowledge of the Qur'an and its related sciences, he impressed all with his circles on tafsir. He also
	attained expertise in Usul Al-Fiqh and Fiqh knowledge of the differences of opinions present amongst the
	scholars, writing, mathematics, history, astronomy and medicine. Many of the scholars of his time
	testified that he had attained the rank of Mujtahid.
</p>
<p>
	He always showed a great concern for the affairs and welfare of the Muslims and this manifested itself
	greatly in his efforts during the Jihad against the Tartars, Christians and Raiveidah wherein his
	displays of bravery, courage and inspiring talks were one of the most important factors in the Muslims
	victory against their enemies. These efforts won the praise and admiration of many scholars and indeed
	the ensuing generations of Muslims to this very day.</p>
<p>
	Aside from the physical Jihad, ibn Taymiyyah launched an intellectual struggle against the various
	deviant sects and heretical ideas of his day. He refuted the Shia, the People of Theological Rhetoric
	(Ahl al-Kalam) - such as the Jahmiyyah, Mu'tazilah and many of Asha'irah, the philosophers who promoted
	the school of the early Greeks (falasifa), the majority of Sufi sects and paths and the adherents of
	other religions. His criticisms were not based on a lack of understanding, rather he first gained an
	in-depth knowledge of each of these schools and as such his critique of them was systematic, acute and
	valid. For example it is said that his refutation of Greek philosophy was one of the most devastating
	attacks ever leveled against them. His refutation of Christianity was outstanding and his rebuttal of the
	Shia completely demolished their beliefs and innovations from root to branch.
</p>
<p>
	Needless to say, these refutations, and his very direct methods of refuting, made him many enemies and as
	a result his life was full of trials and persecutions. His enemies were careful to look for anything by
	which they could attack him and they eventually found what they were looking for in his works of belief
	entitled Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah and Aqidah al-Hamawiyyah. Due to their total misunderstanding of what he
	wrote, they accused him of anthropomorphism and had him imprisoned on more than one occasion. Ibn Kathir
	mentions that some scholars sat with ibn Taymiyyah to debate with him concerning his Aqidah al-Wisitiyyah
	and the debate ending with their agreeing with him in what he had written.<sup></sup> Similarly ibn
	Kathir mentions that some scholars debated with him concerning Aqidah Al-Hamawiyyah and his replies to
	their accusations could not be rebutted. Ibn Taymiyyah was again imprisoned because of a legal ruling he
	gave concerning divorce, and yet again he was later imprisoned for a legal verdict he issued prohibiting
	making journeys for the purpose of visiting graves. It was during this imprisonment that he passed away.
</p>
<p>
	With regards his personality and worship, he exerted a huge and lasting influence on all who met him and
	he was known for his worship and glorification of the Islamic laws, both inwardly and outwardly. His
	complete reliance upon Allah can be best summed up in what his student, Ibn al-Qayyim, relates from him
	when he was told that his enemies had plotted to kill him or imprison him,
</p>
<p class="quote">
	If they kill me it will be martyrdom for me. If they expel me, it will be migration for me; if they
	expel me to Cyprus, I will call its people to Allah so that they answer me. If they imprison me, it will
	be a place of worship for me.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Ibn al-Qayyim himself said,
</p>
<p class="quote">
	Allah knows, I have never seen anyone who had a better life than his. Despite the difficulties and all
	that expunges comfort and luxury, nay, things completely opposite to them; despite imprisonment,
	intimidation and oppression, Ibn Taymiyyah had a purer life than anyone could. He was the most generous,
	the strongest of heart and the most joyful of souls, with the radiance of bliss in his face. When we were
	seized with fear and our thoughts turned negative, and the earth grew narrow for us, we would go to him.
	No sooner did we look at him and hear his words, all these feelings would leave us to be replaced by
	relief, strength, certainty and tranquillity.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Al-Bazzar said,
</p>
<p class="quote">
	I was of those who knew well his habits, he would not talk to anyone unnecessarily after the prayer of
	Fajr and would remain performing the dhikr of Allah in a low voice which perhaps could just be heard by
	one sitting next to him; and frequently would he direct his gaze to the sky. This he would do until the
	Sun had risen high and the time in which it is prohibited to pray was over.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	He also said,
</p>
<p class="quote">
	I have not seen him mention any of the pleasures and attractions of this world, he did not delve into
	worldly conversations and he never asked for any of its livelihood. Instead he directed his attentions
	and conversations to seeking the Hereafter and what could get him closer to Allah.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Once, the ruler Muhammad bin Qalawun accused him of wanting to wrench kingship from him due to his large
	following to which he replied,
</p>
<p class="quote">
	I would do that! By Allah, your kingship and the kingship of Moghul is not even worth two meagre coins in
	my eyes!<sup></sup>
