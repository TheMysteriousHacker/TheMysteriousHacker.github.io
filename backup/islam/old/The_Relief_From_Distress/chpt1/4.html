<h3>The Praise Of The Scholars For Him</h3>
<p>
	Many scholars praised ibn Taymiyyah, not only for his scholarly achievements but also for his active
	participation in Jihad and the affairs relating to public welfare, his abundant concern for others and
	his worship.
</p>
<p>Al Hafiz adh-Dhahabi said:</p>
<p class="quote">
	It was amazing when he mentioned an issue over which there was a difference of opinion and when he gave
	evidence and decided the strongest opinion - he could perform ijtihad due to Hs fulfilling its
	conditions. I have not seen one who was quicker than he at recalling a verse which pertained to the issue
	that he derived from it, nor a man who was stronger in recalling texts and referring them to their sources.
	The Sunnah was in front of his eyes and upon the tip of his tongue with eloquent phrases and an open eye.
</p>
<p class="quote">
	He was a sign from the signs of Allah in tafsir and expounding upon it. With regards to the foundation of
	the religion and knowledge of the differing opinions [on an issue], he was unequalled - this alongside his
	generosity, courage and lack of attention to the joys of the soul.
</p>
<p class="quote">
	Quite possibly his legal rulings in the various sciences reached three hundred volumes, indeed more and
	he was always saying the truth for the sake of Allah, not caring for the blame that came to him.
</p>
<p class="quote">
	Whosoever associates with him and knows him well accuses me of falling short with regards to him.
	Whosoever opposes him and differs with him accuses me of exaggeration, and I have been wronged by both
	parties - his companions and his opponents.
</p>
<p class="quote">
	He was white skinned with black hair and a black beard with a few grey hairs. His hair reached his
	earlobes and his eyes were eloquent tongues. He had broad shoulders and a loud, clear voice with a fast
	recitation. He was quick to anger but overcame it with patience and forbearance.
</p>
<p class="quote">
	I have not seen his like for supplications [to Allah], his seeking succour with Him and his abundant
	concern for others. However I do not believe him to be infallible, rather I differ with him on both
	fundamental and subsidiary matters, for he - despite his vast learning, extreme courage, fluid mind and
	regard for the sanctity of the religion - was a man from amongst men. He could be overcome with sharpness
	and anger in discussion, and attack his opponents [verbally] hence planting enmity in their souls towards him.
</p>
<p class="quote">
	If only he were gentle to his opponents then there would have been a word of agreement over him - for
	indeed their great scholars bowed to his learning, acknowledged his ability, lack of mistakes and
	conceded that he was an ocean having no limits and a treasure having no equivalent.
</p>
<p class="quote">
	He used to preserve the prayers and fasts, glorifying the laws outwardly and inwardly. He did not give
	legal rulings out of poor understanding for he was extremely intelligent, nor out of lack of knowledge
	for he was an overflowing ocean. Neither did he play with the religion but derived evidence from the
	Qur'an, Sunnah and, Qiyas (analogy), he proved [his stances] and argued following the footsteps of the
	Imams who preceded him, so he has a reward if he erred and two rewards if he was correct.
</p>
<p class="quote">
	He fell ill in the castle [wherein he was imprisoned] with a serious disease until he died on the night
	of Monday 20th Dhul-Qa`dah, and they prayed over him in the Magid of Damascus. Afterwards many talked
	about the number that attended his funeral prayer, and the least number given was fifty thousand.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>Ibn Hajr Al-Asqalani said:</p>
<p class="quote">
	The Shaykh of our Shaykhs, Abu al-Yu'mari [ibn Sayyid an-Nas] said in his biography of ibn Taymiyyah,
	`al-Mizzi encouraged me to express my opinion on Shaykh al-Islam Taqi ad-Din. I found him to be from
	those who had acquired a fortune of knowledge in the sciences that he had. He used to completely memorise
	and implement the Sunan and Athar (narrations). Should he speak about tafsir, he would carry its flag,
	and should he pass a legal ruling in fiqh, he knew its limits. Should he speak about a hadith, he was the
	seat of its knowledge and fully cognisant of its narrations. Should he give a lecture on religions and
	sects, none was seen who was more comprehensive or meticulous than he. He surpassed his contemporaries in 
	every science, you would not see one like him and his own eye did not see one like himself.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>He also said,</p>
<p class="quote">
	The acclaim of Taqi ad-Din is more renown then that of the Sun and titling him Shaykh al-Islam of his era
	remains until our time upon the virtuous tongues. It will continue tomorrow just as it was yesterday. No
	one refutes this but a person who is ignorant of his prestige or the one who turns away from justice...
</p>
<p class="quote">
	...those of his stances that were rejected from him were not said by him due to mere whims and desires
	and neither did he obstinately and deliberately persist in them after the evidence was established
	against him. Here are his works overflowing with refutations of those who held to taj'sim
	(anthropomorphism), yet despite this he is a man who makes mistakes and is also correct. So that which he
	is correct in - and that is the majority - is to benefited from and Allah's Mercy should be sought for him
	due to it, and that which he is incorrect in should not be blindly followed. Indeed he is excused for his
	mistakes because he is one of the Imams of his time and it has been testified that he fulfilled the
	conditions of ijtihad...
</p>
<p class="quote">
	From the astonishing qualities of this man was that he was the severest of people against the People of
	Innovation, the 1?Rawafidah, the Huluiyyah and the Ittihadiyyah. His works on this are many and famous
	and his fatawa on them cannot be counted, so how the eyes of these innovators must have found joy when
	they heard those who declared him to be a kafir! And how delighted they must have been when they saw
	those who did not declare him to be a kafir in turn being labeled kafir! It is obligatory upon the one
	who has donned the robe of knowledge and possesses intelligence that he consider the words of a man based
	upon his well-known books or from the tongues of those who are trusted to accurately convey his words.
	Then he should isolate from all of this what is rejected and warn against it with the intention of giving
	sincere advice and to praise him for his excellent qualities and for what he was correct in, as is the way
	of the scholars.
</p>
<p class="quote">
	If there were no virtues of Shaykh Tayi ad-Din except for his famous student Shaykh Shams ad-Din ibn
	al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah, writer of many works, from which both his opponents and supporters benefited,
	then this would be a sufficient indication of his [ibn Taymiyyah's] great position. And how could it be
	otherwise when the Shafi'i Imams and others, not to speak of the Hanbalis, of his time testified to his
	prominence in the [Islamic] sciences.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>Ibn Kathir said,</p>
<p class="quote">
	The least he would do when he heard something was to memorise it and then busy himself with learning it.
	He was intelligent and had much committed to memory, he became an Imam in tafsir and everything linked to
	it and knowledgeable in fiqh. Indeed it was said that he was more knowledgeable of the fiqh of the madhhabs
	than the followers of those very same madhhabs in his time and other than his time. He was a scholar in
	Usul and the branches of the religion, in grammar, the language and other textual and intellectual
	sciences.... no scholar of a science would speak to him except that he thought that science was the
	specialty of ibn Taymiyyah. As for hadith then he was the carrier of its flag, a Hafiz, able to
	distinguish the weak from the strong, fully acquainted with the narrators...<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>He also said,</p>
<p class="quote">
	He was, may Allah have mercy upon him, from the greatest of scholars but also from those who err and are
	correct. However his errors with respect to his correct rulings were like a drop in a huge ocean and they
	are forgiven him as is authentically reported by Bukhari, "When a ruler makes a ruling, and he is correct
	then he has Two rewards, and if he has erred then he has one reward".
</p>
<p>Al-Hafiz al-Mizzi said,</p>
<p class="quote">
	I have not seen the likes of him and his own eye had not seen the likes of himself. I have not seen one
	who was more knowledgeable than he of the Book and the Sunnah of His Messenger, nor one who followed them
	more closely.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>A-Hafiz `Abdur-Rahman ibn Rajab al-Hanbali said,</p>
<p class="quote">
	He is the Imam, the legal Jurist, the Mujtahid, the Scholar of Hadith, the Hafiz, the Explainer of the
	Qur'an, the Ascetic, Taqi ad-Din Abu al-'Abbas Shaykh al-Islam, the most knowledgeable of the
	knowledgeable. It is not possible to exaggerate his renown when he is mentioned and his fame does not
	require us to write a lengthy tract on him He, may Allah have mercy upon him, was unique in his time with
	respect to understanding the Qur'an and knowledge of the realities of faith...<sup></sup>
