<h3>Introduction To Prophet Yunus</h3>
<p class="arabic" verse="37:139"></p>
<p class="quote">Yunus too was one of the Messengers</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="4:163"></p>
<p class="quote">
	We have revealed to you as We revealed to Nuh and the Prophets who came after him. We revealed to Ibrahim
	and Isma`il and Ishaq and Ya'qub and the Tribes, and 'Isa and Ayyub and Yunus and Haroon and Sulayman.
	And We gave Dawood the Zabur.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="6:86"></p>
<p class="quote">And Isma'il, Al-Yasa', Yunus and Lut, all of them We favoured over all beings.</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="68:50"></p>
<p class="quote">His Lord chose him and made him one of the rightneous.</p>
<p>
	Born in Ninevah, Mosul<sup></sup> , Yunus bin Matta was one of two Prophets who was named after his
	mother, the other being 'Isa. He was sent to his people as a Messenger to call them to the worship of
	Allah alone, to call them to abandon their sinful ways. He spent thirty three years of his life in
	pursuit of this mission and in all of this time, only a handful of people believed; finally, in despair,
	Yunus supplicated to his Lord that His punishment descend upon his nation. He was commanded to preach to
	his people for a further forty days, when three days remained he proclaimed amongst his people that
	punishment would afflict them in three days and fled,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="21:87"></p>
<p class="quote">...and Dhun-Nun when he left in anger and thought we would not punish him.</p>
<p>
	His people gathered together and agreed amongst themselves that Yunus was a person who was not known to
	lie, and when they saw that he had indeed fled, they became certain of the imminent punishment and
	repented, so Allah forgave them and showed them mercy.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="10:98"></p>
<p class="quote">
	How is it that there has never been a city who believed, whose belief brought them benefit, except the
	people of Yunus? When they believed, We removed from them the punishment of disgrace in the life of this
	world and We let them have enjoyment for a time.
</p>
<p>
	In the meantime, Yunus awaited news of what had happened to his people, and finally a traveler passed by
	him informing him that his people had become believers and the punishment had averted them. Fearing
	disgrace and being called a liar he determined not to return, and embarked upon a heavily laden ship
	destined for Tarshish, but it was not very long before they were overcome with bad weather. The travelers
	agreed that they must lighten their load by throwing some passengers overboard, they drew lots and the
	name of Yunus came up, they were however reluctant to throw him overboard, seeing him to be a pious man
	and repeated the drawing of lots three times. His name came up each time.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="37:140-141"></p>
<p class="quote">When he ran away to the fully laden ship and cast lots and lost.</p>
<p>
	Upon being thrown into the sea, he was swallowed by a huge whale and by the decree of Allah allowed to
	live in its belly, it is reported that at this time he supplicated saying, 'my Lord! I have been granted
	a place to pray where no one else has worshipped you before!'
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="37:142"></p>
<p class="quote">then the fish devoured him and he was to blame</p>
<p>He remained in the belly of the whale, glorifying Allah,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="37:143-144"></p>
<p>
	Realising that he had done something unbefitting in abandoning his people and fleeing before being
	granted permission by his Lord, and that this was the cause of his trial,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="21:87-88"></p>
<p class="quote">
	He called out in the pitch darkness, "There is none worthy of worship save You, Glory be to You, far
	removed are You from any imperfection; I have been among the wrongdoers." We responded to him and rescued
	him from his grief, that is how We rescue the believers.
</p>
<p>
	At-Tabari records on the authority of ibn Wahb that this supplication appeared beneath the Throne and the
	Angels said that they heard a very weak voice coming from a strange land. Allah said, "Do you not know
	who that is? He is Our servant, Yunus." The Angels said, Tour servant Yunus, from whom there has always
	ascended to You an accepted prayer and an accepted deed?' Allah replied, "Yes" and commanded the whale to
	throw him out on the open shore.
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="37:145-146"></p>
<p class="quote">So We cast him up onto the beach and he was sick and We caused a gourd tree to grow over him.</p>
<p>
	After having regained health and strength, Yunus returned to his people to inform them that Allah had
	indeed forgiven them and his people welcomed him with open arms,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="37:147-148"></p>
<p class="quote">We sent him to a hundred thousand or more. They believed and so We gave them enjoyment for a time.</p>
<p>The Prophet PBUH said,</p>
<p class="quote">
	The invocation of my brother Dhan-Nun, "None has the right to be worshipped save You; glory be to You,
	far removed are You from any imperfection; I have been amongst the wrong-doers," none who is experiencing
	difficulty employs it except that Allah would relieve him of his difficulty.
</p>
<p>
	This book, authored by ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, explains in detail the meaning of the
	supplication of Yunus and the meaning of this hadith.<sup></sup>
