<h3>The Meaning Of Dua</h3>
<p>In the Qur'an, the word dua and da'wah is used in two senses:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Dua al-Ibadah: supplication through worship</li>
	<li>Dua al-Mas'alah: the supplication of request<sup></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Allah, Exalted is He, says:</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="26:213"></p>
<p class="quote">
	So do not supplicate to any other god along with Allah or you will be among those who will be punished.
</p>
<ol id="reference">
	<li>
		The first type of dua can be understood when one understands that every act of worship is done with
		the unstated plea that Allah accept that action of worship and the desire to draw closer to him, and
		hence attain His pleasure. Hence every action of worship is a type of request to Allah. The second
		type of dua is whereby one explicitly asks his Lord of something such as 'O Allah! Grant me good in
		this world and the Hereafter.' The second type includes the first type and the first type
		necessitates the second type.
