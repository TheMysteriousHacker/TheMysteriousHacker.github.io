<h3>Wudhoo in the Arabic Language</h3>
<p>
    Wudhoo is the action, and wadoo the water used therefore - and it is also a verbal noun; or they are two forms of the same word, both meaning the verbal-noun and maybe both referring also to the water used.

<h3>Wudhoo in the Sharee'ah</h3>
<p>
    Wudhoo is using clean and cleansing (Tuhoor) water upon certain body parts as Allaah Ta'aala has prescribed and explained.
