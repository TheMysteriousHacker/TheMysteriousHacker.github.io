<h3>His Death</h3>
<p>
	Ibn Taymiyyah died while imprisoned on the twentieth of Dhul Qa`dah of the year 728H, after ultimately
	being banned from reading or writing. He fell sick for the few days preceding his death.
</p>
<p>
	His funeral was attended by a huge congregation despite the many lies and slanders being spread about him
	by certain innovators of his time. Al-Bazzar says,
</p>
<p class="quote">
	Once the people had heard of his death, not a single person in Damascus who was able to attend the prayer
	and wanted to remained except that he appeared and was present for it. As a result, the markets in
	Damascus were closed and all transactions of livelihood were stopped... Governors, heads, scholars,
	jurists all came out. They say that none of the majority of the people failed to turn up - according to
	my knowledge - except three individuals; they were well known for their enmity for ibn Taymiyyah and thus,
	hid away from the people out of fear for their lives.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>Ibn Kathir said,</p>
<p class="quote">
	There were so many people in front of his funeral, behind it, to its right and to its left. None but
	Allah could enumerate them, and then someone shouted, 'this is how the funerals of the Imams of the
	Sunnah are to be!' At that the people started to cry... When the call to prayer for Zuhr was proclaimed
	they prayed after it straight away against the usual norm. Once they finished prayer, the deputy khatib
	came out - as the main khatib was absent and in Egypt - and he led the prayer over ibn Taymiyyah... then
	the people poured out from everywhere and all the doors of the Masjid... and they assembled at al-Khayl
	market.<sup></sup></p>
