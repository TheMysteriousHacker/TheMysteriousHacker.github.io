<h3>The Meaning Of Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim - The Most Gracious, The Most Merciful</h3>
<p>
	Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim are two names derived from Ar-Rahmah (the mercy), but Rahman has more meanings that pertain to mercy than Ar-Rahim.
</p>
<p>
	Further, Al-Qurtubi said, "The proof that these names are derived (from Ar-Rahmah), is what At-Tirmidhi recorded, and graded Sahih, from
	Abdur-Rahman bin Awf that he heard the Messenger of Allah pbuh say,
</p>
<p class="arabic">قَالَ اللهُ تَعَالى: أَنَا الرَّحْمنُ خَلَقْتُ الرَّحِمَ وَشَقَقْتُ لَهَا اسْمًا مِنِ اسْمِي، فَمَنْ وَصَلَهَا وَصَلْتُهُ وَمَنْ قَطَعَها قَطَعْتُهُ</p>
<p class="quote">
	Allah the Exalted said, 'I Am Ar-Rahman. I created the Raham (womb, i.e. family relations) and derived a name for it from My Name. Hence,
	whoever keeps it, I will keep ties to him, and whoever severs it, I will sever ties with him.'
</p>
<p>
	He then said, "This is a text that indicates the derivation."
</p>
<p>
	Abu Ali Al-Farisi said: Ar-Rahman, which is exclusively for Allah, is a name that encompasses every type of mercy that Allah has. Ar-Rahim
	is what effects the believers, for Allah said,
</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="33:43">وَكَانَ بِٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَحِيمًۭا</p>
<p class="quote">And He is ever Rahim (merciful) to the believers.</p>
<p>As for Allah's statement,</p>
<p class="arabic" verse="20:5"></p>
<p>Allah mentioned the Istawa along with His Name Ar-Rahman, to indicate that His mercy encompasses all of His creation.</p>
