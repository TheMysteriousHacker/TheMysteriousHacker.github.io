<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
	All praise is for Allaah. We praise Him and seek His help and forgiveness. We turn to him in repentance
	and seek refuge in Allaah from the evil of our selves and the wickedness of our own deeds. Whomsoever
	Allaah guides cannot be lead astray and whomsoever Allaah misguides, none can guide him. I bear witness
	that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone without any partner and I bear witness that
	Muhammad (PBUH) is His slave and Messenger. May Allaah praise and send much peace upon him and all of his
	Companions.
</p>
<p>
	The lofty rank and high station eemaan possesses is not something obscure, as it is unquestionably the
	most important duty as well as being the most imperative of all obligations. It is also the greatest and
	most glorious of them. All the good in the world and the Hereafter is dependent upon the presence of
	eemaan and on its soundness and integrity.
</p>
<p>
	Eemaan holds such a multitude of benefits, ripe fruits, delicious produce, constant food and continual
	goodness.
</p>
<p>
	For the Muslim who is granted the tawfeeq, his concern for his eemaan is greater than any other concern
	he may have - and this must be so. When this became evident to the Salaf of this Ummah, the first and
	best of this ummah, their concern for their eemaan was very eminent and the attention they gave to it was
	enormous.
</p>
<p>
	They (may Allaah be pleased and have mercy upon them) used to tend to their eemaan, inspect their actions,
	and give each other advice. Reports of this nature from the Salaf are numerous:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		‘Umar Ibn al-Khattaab, may Allaah be pleased with him, used to say to his companions: "Come on, so
		that we may increase our eemaan".
	</li>
	<li>
		‘Abdullaah Ibn Mas’ood, may Allaah be pleased with him, used to say: "Sit with us, so that we may
		increase in eemaan." He used to say in his supplications: "O Allaah increase me in Eemaan, certainty
		and understanding".
	</li>
	<li>
		 Aboo Dardaa’, may Allaah be pleased with him, used to say: "It is from the intelligence of the
		 servant to know whether he is increasing or decreasing, and indeed, it is from the intelligence of
		 the servant to know how, where and when the whispers of Shaytaan appear to him."
	</li>
	<li>
		‘Abdur-Rahmaan ibn ‘Amr al-Awzaa’ee, may Allaah have mercy upon him, was asked about eemaan: "Does it
		increase?" He replied, "Yes, until it becomes like mountains. He was then asked, 'Does it decrease?'
		He answered, 'Yes, up until there is nothing left of it.'
	</li>
	<li>
		 <span>
		 	The Imaam of the Ahl as-Sunnah Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may Allaah have mercy upon him, was asked as to
		 	whether eemaan increases and decreases. He replied: "It increases until it reaches the highest part
		 	of the seventh heaven, and it decreases until it reaches the lowest part of the seventh plane."
		 </span>
		 <span>
		 	He also used to say: "Eemaan is speech and action. It increases and decreases. If you perform good
		 	deeds, it increases, and if you do wrong, it decreases."
		 </span>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	If one also reflects on their biographies and reads their tales, one will notice the intense concern they
	attached to the issue of eemaan and the great attention they gave to it.
</p>
<p>
	These virtuous people knew that eemaan has many causes, which increase it, strengthen it, and make it
	grow, and likewise, that it has several other causes, which decrease it weaken it and undermine it.
</p>
<p>
	The knowledge therefore, of these causes, i.e., causes for the increase and decrease of eemaan, entails
	great and abundant benefits.
</p>
<p>
	In fact, the knowledge and personification of these causes and focusing on them is of dire necessity.
	This is because eemaan signifies perfection for the servant, and it is the way towards his success and
	happiness. By eemaan, the servant’s rank rises in this world and the Hereafter. It is the reason and
	route to all worldly and heavenly good, and it does not come about, obtain strength, or become complete,
	without knowledge of it's ways and causes.
</p>
<p>
	Hence, it is very appropriate for the Muslim servant, the adviser to his own self and the one eager over
	his own happiness, to strive to acquaint himself with these causes. He should ponder over them and then
	apply them in his life, so that his eemaan increases and his certainty strengthens. He must also distance
	himself from the causes that decrease eemaan, and safeguard his self from committing them, so that he
	delivers himself from their ill end and painful consequences. The one who is granted the tawfeeq to this
	has indeed been given the tawfeeq to all good. 
</p>
<p>
	The great scholar ibn Sa'dee, may Allaah have mercy upon him, says, "The servant, Muslim, who has been
	granted the tawfeeq, does not cease from working towards two things:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Fulfilling Eemaan and its subsidiaries, and establishing it in speech, action and state.</li>
	<li>
		<span>
			Striving to repel the apparent and hidden forms of fitan, which negate, invalidate or decrease
			eemaan. 
 		</span>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	The Muslim employs sincere repentance as a remedy for the short comings he has in the first mailer as
	well as for that (i.e., the fitan) which he boldly embarked upon in the second matter in addition to
	taking steps to make amends before it is too late.<sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
	Hence, the discussion before you contains an explanation and clarification of the most important causes
	for the increase and decrease of eemaan.</p>
