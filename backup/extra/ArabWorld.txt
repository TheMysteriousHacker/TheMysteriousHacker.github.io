Arabs:

The Arabs studied chemistry.. Recognizing that gold was the most precious metal, many spent thier lives and thier riches in a vain endeavour to convert baser metal into it, and in the course of these experiments they gleaned much information on other matters.

They found that heating various subtances, something invisible was given off which they could colled in glass bottles, and to this they gave the name of "spirit," likening it to what they believed was the soul.

Geber:

One chemist that probably lived in the ninth century was called Geber. He showed the process of distillation. He showed that by slowly heating a mixture of water and alchohol, the "spirit of wine", came off as a vapour at a lower temperature than that at which the water began to evaporate. This spirit could be collected and condensed separately as alchohol.

He also found that he could obtain vapours form solids directly by the process known as "sublimation." One of the solids he experimented with was cinnabar, a red mineral which found in many parts of the world, but Geber probably obtained it from Carniola or Hungary. On heating this substance a vapour was given off which condensed intoo droplets of quick-silver (which we call mercury). This metal was known to Aristotle, and also a Greek physician, Dioscorides, who lived in the first century.

Geber noticed that metals, when headted in air, gained in weight.
