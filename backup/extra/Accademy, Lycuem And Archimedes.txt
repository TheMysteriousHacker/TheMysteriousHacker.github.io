The Academy And Lyceum:

In ancient Athens, there were two great schoold, known as Academy and Lycuem. The head of the former was Plato and for the latter aws Aristotle.

The Alexandrine Museum:

A new university was rising in Egypt to take place of the Lyceum. This was Museum, or Abode of the Muses (the patron divinities in Greek mythology of the arts), which was founded by Ptolemy Soter, one of the generals of Alexander the Great.

Archimedes:

Archimedes was born in Syracuse (287 BC), and studied adn afterwards taught in the MuseumHe was the first to make out the numerical relation between the circumference of a circle and its diameter. He is oftern credited with the discovery of the lever but what he really did discover were the laws which goverened its working. Another discovery was the law of specific gravity.

He invented an endless screw for raising water. It consists of a tube wound round an inclined axis, with one end dipping in the water to be raised, adn the other end over a tank. The water slowly mounts as the tube starts rotating, like an automatic spiral staircase.
