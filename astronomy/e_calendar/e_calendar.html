<h3>The Egyptian Calendar:</h3>

<p class="pmain2">The heliacal rising is a rising of a star that occurs annually when it briefly becomes visible above
the eastern horizon at dawn just before sunrise, after a period of less than a year when it had not been visible.
Historically, the most important such rising is that of a star called Sirius, which was an important feature of the
Egyptian calendar.</p>

<p class="pmain2">The Egyptians kept
careful track of the rising time of the bright star Sirius in the predawn sky, which has a yearly cycle that
corresponded with the flooding of the Nile River. The year consisted of three seasons of 120 days each, each season was
divided into four months of 30 days. There was also an intercalary month of 5 days treated as outside of the year. The
five intercalary days were used to celebrate the gods' birthdays and the Egyptians weren't expected to work during this
time.</p>

<p class="pmain2">The first season was known as <em>Flood</em> (Akhet), refering to the flood itself. The second season was known as <em>Emergence</em>
(Peret), refering to the emergence of the fertile land beside the Nile from its annual flood and to the growth of
vegetation and crops over the following season, known as <em>Low Water</em> (Shimu), refering to the state of Nile
before the flood.</p>

<p class="pmain2">Because this calendrical year was nearly a quarter of a day shorter than the solar year, the Egyptian
calendar lost about one day every four years relative to the Gregorian calendar. It is therefore sometimes referred to
as the wandering year, as its months rotated about one day through the solar year every 4 years.</p>
